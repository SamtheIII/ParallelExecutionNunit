# ParalleExecutionNunit
This repository contains the Sample code to run parallel tests in Nunit+Selenium+C#. I have written this code to demonstrate the parallel execution on the Class level.
assemblyinfo.cs file is important because it tells the Nunit adapter to run the test scripts on the Fixture level.

Time:
with out Parallel execution: 31.7
with Parallel execution: 15.9
